        VCalendarContentConverter.fixTaskDates(..) with fixDates(..) in order to

        set startDatePattern and endDatePattern in local time when the recurrence

        timezone with semicolon in the value (for instance +03:00).
- lulu: Deprecated VCalendarContentConverter(TimeZone timezone, String charset).
        Added VCalendarContentConverter constructor with convertDateToLocal as

        Changed the signature of 
        VCalendarContentConverter.getExceptionsAsList(..) adding the isAllDay
        boolean parameter because if the recurrence exception is an allday, the

2008-03-25
- diogo: fixed Tasks - BillingInformation now we handle this property in a Server to Client sync

2008-03-18
- diogo: fixed Tasks - com.funambol.common.pim.converter.VCalendarContentConverter.cc2vcc
         is used to convert both VCal Events and Tasks and on some clients we want to suport 
         tasks don't use all day property so I updated this method with a check like "if isAllDAy == null do nothing" to avoid NullPointerExceptions in the convertion

- mauro: Fixed a bug with SIF-T items lacking the PercentComplete tag. The
         completion percentage is now being inferred from the value of the
