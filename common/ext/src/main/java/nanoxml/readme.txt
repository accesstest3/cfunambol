This is a port of version 1.6.8 of NanoXML for CLDC-based J2ME profiles.
Done by Eric Giguere, ericgiguere@ericgiguere.com.

Changes I made:

July 23, 2001
-------------

-- replaced references to non-CLDC J2SE classes with equivalents
-- used lazy instantiation for creation of attribute hashtables and
   child element vectors
-- removed most spurious references to "this.xxxxx"
