OK, that means you are talking of a calendar object.

As far as I know, vcalendar uses some specific way of referencing
such users. It does not include information like phone number of
that attendee.

ICAL does support them. See section "4.8.4.1 Attendee"
of RFC 2445.

Above you have an ICAL event with an attendee property. I am the
attendee. As you see there is no 'real name' just the email.
The calendar application I use presents this in the calendar
with my 'real name', but that is a conversion on the using calendar
application side based on the local address book.
