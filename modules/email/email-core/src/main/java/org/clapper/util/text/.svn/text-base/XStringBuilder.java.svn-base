/**
 * An <tt>XStringBuilder</tt> objects wraps a standard Java
 * <tt>StringBuilder</tt> object, providing a superset of
 * <tt>StringBuilder</tt>'s functionality. (<tt>XStringBuilder</tt> cannot
 * actually subclass <tt>StringBuilder</tt>, since <tt>StringBuilder</tt>
 * is final.) Among the additional methods that this class provides are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> A set of {@link #split()} methods, to split the contents of the
 *        buffer on a delimiter
 *   <li> A {@link #delete(String) delete()} method that deletes the first
 *        occurrence of a substring. (<tt>StringBuilder</tt> only provides
 *        a <tt>delete()</tt> method that takes a starting and ending index.)
 *   <li> A {@link #replace(String,String) replace()} method that replaces
 *        the first occurrence of a substring. (<tt>StringBuilder</tt> only
 *        provides a <tt>replace()</tt> method that takes a starting and
 *        ending index.)
 *   <li> A {@link #replaceAll(String,String) replaceAll()} method to
 *        replace all occurrences of a substring with something else
 *   <li> Methods to encode and decode metacharacter sequences in place.
 *        (See {@link #encodeMetacharacters()} and
 *        {@link #decodeMetacharacters()}.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Because <tt>XStringBuilder</tt> wraps a <tt>StringBuilder</tt>, it is
 * not thread-safe; but, it is likely to be faster than a
 * <tt>StringBuffer</tt> or an <tt>XStringBuffer</tt>. For applications or
 * methods that must to worry about multiple threads modifying the buffer
 * concurrently, consider using the {@link XStringBuffer} class, instead.
