/**
 * This synclet switches the second with the third value in the address tokens
 * (home, work or other type). The phone for any address, has Street 1 and
 * Street 2. The phone sends the Street 1 in the second position of ADR token
 * where, how specified in the VCard specification, should be the extended
 * address (the server doesn't handle it) and it sends the Street 2 in the third
 * position where, always how specified in the VCard specification, should be
 * the principal street.
 * This switch is done for all address types and only if the Street 1 is not
 * empty.
