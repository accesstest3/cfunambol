/**
 * Contacts:
 * =========
 * Nokia 7610 and Nokia 6630 are not able to handle updates on fields that have the
 * same name. In this case the Telephone field is wrongly updated. 
 * To avoid the issue PREF telephone numbers are removed from sync both in input
 * and output.
 *
 * The issue is described by these different scenarios:
 * Case A)
 * 1) on device create the contact:
 * First Name: John
 * Telephone: 1
 * Default Telephone: 8
 * 2) sync / contact correctly stored on Portal (Main Phone: 1, Alternate Phone: 8)
 * 3) on server modify Alternate Phone: 80 / sync
 * As result on device there are 2 default telephones:
 * Default Telephone: 1
 * Default Telephone: 8
 *
 * Case B)
 * 1) on device create the contact:
 * First Name: Karl
 * Telephone: 1
 * Default Telephone: 8
 * 2) sync / contact correctly stored on Portal (Main Phone: 1, Alternate Phone: 8)
 * 3) on server modify Main Phone: 10 / sync
 * As result on device there are 2 default telephones:
 * Default Telephone: 10
 * Default Telephone: 8
 *
 * The device modifies only the first Telephone in its database according to the
 * value written in the last line of the vcard that is correct in case B) but not
 * in case A).
 * Same issue occurs for the couple TEL;VOICE;WORK and
 * TEL;VOICE;WORK;PREF sent by device.
