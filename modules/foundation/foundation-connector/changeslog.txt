2010-05-27
- machi: Corrected a typo in the copyright
- machi: fixed Bug 8813  - First user signup receives 'Unknown exception in 
         picture handling' error popup.
         The bug was caused by an exception thrown upon the failure in the creation
         of the user directory used to store pictures. In order to avoid that,
         - the path of the user directory is normalized (removing properly '..' 
         and '.') before proceeding to create it.
         - if the directory doesn't exist, the creation call of mkdirs method is 
         performed inside a block synchronized using a ReentrantLock.
         - if the creation of the directory fails, an exception is thrown if and
         only if the directory doesn't exist.
         Added multithread junit in order to test concurrent creation of user
         directory.  
         Removed dependencies from the commons-io api since the sapi don't have
         the right jar version in the classpath.

             updateItem and addItem methods.

         PIMCalendarSyncSource in order to reject the adding of items that don't 
         contain any field used for the twin search.
         Updated the manager and dao layer to skip the twin search for items that
         don't contain any field used for the twin search and for checking if

         Removed from the parent class PIMEntityManager the reference to the
         PIMEntityDAO and use instead the abstract method getEntityDAO()

2009-09-20
- nichele: Merged improvements from v8 branch:
           Improved modification lists handling. Instead of performing 3 different
           queries to get NEW, UPDATED, DELETED items, just one query is performed.
           This approach is better since:
           - in any case the server asks for NEW, UPDATED, DELETED items in a row
             keeping the lists in memory
           - usually a sync is performed with just few modifications
           - 1 query is better than 3 since DB load

2009-09-01
- lulu: Fixed bug #7745 - MySQL issue: it seems is not using some of the indexes

2009-06-12
- lulu: Moved default queries from PSDeviceInventory.xml to

        components for testing and so it's difficult to handle it rightly).

2009-06-11
- lulu: Updated ConfigManager class since now the ConfigItem object is based on
        username besides the sync4jPrincipal.

2009-06-05

         source).

         - getItemState and getItemsHavingStatus to the parent class EntityDAO

2009-04-06
- mauro: Extended FileDataObject to include all data prescribed by the OMA
         specification.

2009-04-02
- piter: Added file data object syncsource. This source stores:
         - in the database table fnbl_file_data_object all the synchronization data
         - in the filesystem the whole xml file data object document

         Database modifications:
         - added table fnbl_file_data_object
         - added source type for file data object (fdo-foundation) to the foundation
           connector

- piter: Refactoring:
         - moved common properties pim wrapper classes to the new
           parent class EntityWrapper.
         - added DBAccessException to represent exception thrown by generic sync
           sources not strictly related to pim (eg: file data object sync source).
           Now PIMDBAccessException inherits from DBAccessException.
         - added EntityDAO used by sources not strictly related to pim (eg: file
           data object sync source).
           Now PIMEntityDAO inherits from EntityDAO.

        at each slow sync.
        Changed the policy to search contact twins when a contact has first name,
        last name, company and email null or empty but it has email home address
        and/or email work address set. In this case, email home and/or email work
        will be used to find twin in order to avoid duplicated.

2008-10-08

         (subject varchar(255), textdescription varchar(65535), categories varchar(255),
         folder  varchar(255)).

-----------------------------------

2007-11-23
- nichele: Modified PIMContactSyncSource in order to avoid sending contacts with
           photo as default behavior. The photos are sent just if the sourceQuery
           contains 'photo=true'. This is done since a lot of phones are not able
           to perform a sync if the server sends back the contacts with the photo
           since the contacts are too big and:
           1. or the phone is not able to  handle in the right way the large object
           2. or the contacts are discharged by the server since the phone doesn't
              support large object and the max msg size is too small.

              timezone is not null, the dates are converted;
            - if device.getConvertDate is equal to ConvertDatePolicy.UNSPECIFIED, the device
              doesn't support UTC (from its capabilities), and the timezone is not null,
              the dates are converted;
            - otherwise no conversion is performed.

- lulu: Updated Funambol copyright


-----------------------------------
Funambol Foundation Connector 6.0.6
-----------------------------------

2007-06-11
- mauro: Changed behaviour with empty PIM data: zero-length contact and
         calendar items are not saved as empty items on the DB; they raise
         a "No data" exception instead, thus letting the server skip them
         and process only the other ones.


-----------------------------------
Funambol Foundation Connector 6.0.5
-----------------------------------

           to "Foundation" (in the init_schema.sql script files)

2007-04-10

         absolute time trigger at add and update time.

- mauro: Fixed order of fields in the contact update query.

2007-04-05

         DSTART will be accepted, even though it should have been set to
         the day after according to the vCalendar/iCalendar specifications.

-----------------------------------
Funambol Foundation Connector 6.0.1

2007-02-15
- lulu: Removed wrong instance variable from SourceUriPrefixSynclet and
        ChangeSourceUriSynclet because there is just one PipelineManager so the
        synclets can not store their state in instance variables. They must use
        MessageProcessingContext as "repository"
- mauro: Changed DAO behaviour: contact address items are no more added when
         empty, although they're still set to an empty string if they were
         already present in the DB but have been deleted.

2007-02-13
